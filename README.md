## Game Description

**Skybound Legends** is an exhilarating open-world flying adventure that takes place in a vast sky realm of floating islands and ancient mysteries. Pilot your customizable aircraft through diverse biomes—from lush floating archipelagos to treacherous volcanic zones, crystalline formations, and forgotten ruins suspended in the clouds.

As an aspiring sky pilot, you'll navigate the complex politics of rival factions while uncovering the secrets of a lost sky civilization. Master the art of flight with realistic aerodynamics that balance arcade accessibility with simulation depth, allowing for thrilling dogfights, daring exploration, and precise maneuvers through challenging environments.

The game features a dynamic weather system where raging storms, dense fog, and peaceful clear skies not only transform the visual experience but directly affect your aircraft's handling and mission strategies. Day and night cycles create ever-changing lighting conditions that reveal new perspectives on the breathtaking world around you.

Progress through an engaging storyline while building your reputation across multiple factions. Customize your aircraft with performance upgrades, weapon systems, and visual modifications earned through missions, exploration, and combat. Join flying squadrons with other pilots for cooperative challenges or test your skills in competitive aerial tournaments.

With multiple progression paths focused on exploration, combat, or trade, Skybound Legends offers freedom to carve your own path through the skies while unraveling the mysteries of a forgotten world among the clouds.

## Model Exporter

This project includes a model exporter tool to generate GLB files for all game models. You can:

1. Toggle between different model categories (aircraft, islands, projectiles)
2. Preview each model in 3D space
3. Export any model as a GLB file with one click

### Export Instructions

1. Run the application with `npm start` or `npm run dev`
2. The Model Exporter view is shown by default
3. Select a model category and browse through available models
4. Click "Export as GLB" to save the current model as a GLB file
5. Find exported models in your downloads folder
